# AWS CDK Blog - Creating and Deploying Resources

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) to create and deploy AWS resources. The guide walks through the process of setting up an AWS CDK application, writing infrastructure code in TypeScript, deploying a simple AWS Lambda function, and testing the deployment.

## Overview

In this blog, we will cover the following:

1. **What is AWS CDK?**  
   AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework used to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. It allows developers to use familiar programming languages (like TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.) to define infrastructure, making it easier to create reusable, version-controlled, and testable infrastructure code.

2. **Why Use AWS CDK?**  
   - **Code Reusability:** Write infrastructure code once and reuse it across projects.
   - **Programming Language Support:** Use your preferred programming language instead of YAML/JSON.
   - **Improved Productivity:** Built-in constructs simplify and speed up development.
   - **Integrated Testing:** Validate your infrastructure using standard unit testing tools.

3. **Step-by-Step Guide:**  
   - How to initialize an AWS CDK project.
   - How to create and modify Lambda functions.
   - How to deploy AWS resources using CDK.
   - How to validate your resources after deployment.

## Prerequisites
